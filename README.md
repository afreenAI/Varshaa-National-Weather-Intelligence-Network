# VARSHAA — National Weather Intelligence & Ground-Truth Network

Production-quality React + TypeScript frontend for Smart India Hackathon
Problem Statement 26069 (Ministry of Earth Sciences / IMD).

## Stack
React 18 · TypeScript · Vite · Tailwind CSS · React Router · Zustand ·
Recharts · Leaflet/React-Leaflet · Framer Motion · React Hook Form + Zod

## Run it

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then open the URL Vite prints (usually http://localhost:5173).

To type-check and build for production:

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

The project is intended to be validated locally with `npm install` followed by `npm run build` after dependency installation.

## Architecture

```
src/
├── app/          # App shell + routing
├── components/   # ui, layout, maps, charts, incidents, verification, command-center
├── pages/        # One file per route
├── data/         # Seeded demo data ("DEMO STREAM")
├── services/     # Mock service layer — same interface a real backend would expose
├── store/        # Zustand stores (incidents, dashboard, map)
├── types/        # Shared TypeScript types
└── utils/        # cn() class helper
public/india-states.geojson   # Real, simplified state/UT boundaries (all 36)
```

Every `services/*.ts` file is written as an adapter: swap the mock
implementation for a real `fetch()` call to FastAPI/Kafka/PostGIS/BHASHINI
etc. without touching any component or page.

## Frontend intelligence upgrade

The frontend now groups the product around five simple experiences: Command Center, Live Map, Citizen Report, Incident Intelligence, and Admin Review. The UI includes the planned intelligence layer for: multi-source incident clustering, AI trust/evidence scoring, old/duplicate-media checks, Indian-language normalization, ground-truth gap detection, impact-based risk, predictive escalation, recommended actions, explainable alerts, evidence graphs, hyperlocal coverage, and incident replay.

These intelligence values are intentionally seeded in the frontend for now. The next backend phase can replace each adapter with real weather APIs, IMD/official feeds, database records, NLP/CV models, geospatial clustering, notification gateways and multilingual services without redesigning the UI.

## What's real vs. simplified in this build

**Fully working:** routing across all 13 pages, the Leaflet map with real
(simplified) Indian state boundaries and clickable incident markers, the
incident drawer (Overview/Evidence/Timeline/Media tabs), filterable incident
list, AI Verification Lab pipeline animation + two comparison panels, Citizen
Report form with Zod validation and working photo/video upload + preview,
a voice-to-incident simulation, Recharts analytics, Alert Command with a
live preview, Regional Intelligence map-click panel, Disaster Replay
scrubber, Judge Demo modal (11-step scripted scenario), Admin verification
queue, System Health with auto-refreshing mock metrics, and global
Ctrl/Cmd+K search.

**Simplified for this first delivery** (flagged here rather than glossed
over): map boundaries are simplified polygons, not survey-grade; photo/video
"evidence" in the incident drawer uses labeled placeholder tiles (no real
photos are fabricated, for both honesty and copyright reasons) — the
Citizen Report form's own upload *does* show real thumbnails of whatever you
upload; BHASHINI, real map tiles, and backend services are adapters only,
not live integrations; heatmap/cluster-expansion map layers are UI toggles
without live data behind every layer yet.

## Environment variables

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in real keys when you connect real
services. Nothing is hardcoded.

## Data & ethics notes

All incident, report and analytics data is seeded demo data, clearly
labeled "DEMO STREAM" — no real citizen or government data is used. AI
confidence scores are described as evidence strength, never as proof of
authenticity.
